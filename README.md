To ensure that you are able to install everything properly, I would recommend you to have <b>Yarn</b>, <b>React</b> and <b>Vite</b> installed.
You'll have to set up an AppWrite account, and then add all of the details into your .env file.
Once you've connected your application to AppWrite. Run the commands:
